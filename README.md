## Bio

Chris Donahue is an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at CMU, and a part-time research scientist at Google DeepMind working on the Magenta project. His research goal is to _develop and responsibly deploy generative AI for music and creativity, thereby unlocking and augmenting human creative potential_. In practice, this involves improving machine learning methods for controllable generative modeling of music and audio, and deploying real-world interactive systems that allow anyone to harness generative music AI to accomplish their creative goals through intuitive forms of control. Chrisâ€™s research has been featured in live performances by professional musicians like The Flaming Lips, and also empowers hundreds of daily users to convert their favorite music into interactive content through his website Beat Sage. His work has also received coverage from MIT Tech Review, The Verge, Business Insider, and Pitchfork. Before CMU, Chris was a postdoctoral scholar in the CS department at Stanford advised by Percy Liang. Chris holds a PhD from UC San Diego where he was jointly advised by Miller Puckette (music) and Julian McAuley (CS).

## TODO

- Figure out how Hugo module versioning works so I don't actually bring in breaking changes upstream
- Add auto build of CV to Github Actions
- Media section
- Featured publications section
- Add "Play" section to website (string?)
- Remove stupid publication filtering thing
