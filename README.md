## Bio

Chris Donahue is the Dannenberg Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at CMU, and a part-time research scientist at Google DeepMind working on the Magenta project. 
His research goal is to _empower and enrich human creativity and productivity with generative AI_. 
In practice, this involves improving core machine learning methods for controllable generative modeling of music and audio, developing real-world interactive systems that allow users to harness models for creative expression, and studying their broader impacts on creative work. 
Chrisâ€™s research has been featured in live performances by professional musicians like _The Flaming Lips_ and _Darkside_, and also empowers hundreds of daily users to convert their favorite music into interactive content through his website Beat Sage. 
His work has been recognized with Best Paper awards at the ACM CHI conference and NAACL workshops and received media coverage from MIT Tech Review, The Verge, Business Insider, and Pitchfork. 
Before CMU, Chris was a postdoctoral scholar in the CS department at Stanford advised by Percy Liang. 
Chris holds a PhD from UC San Diego where he was jointly advised by Miller Puckette (music) and Julian McAuley (CS) and supported by the Unity Global Graduate Fellowship.

## TODO

- Figure out how Hugo module versioning works so I don't actually bring in breaking changes upstream
- Add auto build of CV to Github Actions
- Media section
- Featured publications section
- Add "Play" section to website (string?)
