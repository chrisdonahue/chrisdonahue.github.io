I am an **assistant professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://csd.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University**. I am also a **part-time research scientist at [Google Magenta](https://magenta.tensorflow.org)**.

My research goal is to _build music technology that enables a broader set of users to engage with music on a deeper level_. To this end, I improve ML methods for generative modeling of music and other multimedia, and build interactive systems which allow anyone to leverage resultant models.

I focus on real-world systems...

Previously, I was a postdoc at Stanford CS advised by [Percy Liang](https://cs.stanford.edu/~pliang/). Before that, I completed a PhD at UCSD co-advised by [Miller Puckette](https://msp.ucsd.edu/) and [Julian McAuley](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~jmcauley/).
