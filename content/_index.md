        I lead the [**Generative Creativity Lab** (G-CLef) at CMU](https://gclef-cmu.org/). Our mission is to *empower and enrich _human_ creativity and productivity with generative AI*. We focus primarily on the intersection of *music and AI*, though we also work on other applications such as programming, gaming, and natural language. Please [visit this page](https://github.com/gclef-cmu/apply/) to learn more about our research interests and to apply.
