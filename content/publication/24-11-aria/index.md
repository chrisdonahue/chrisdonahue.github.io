abstract: "We present Hookpad Aria, a generative AI system designed to assist musicians in writing Western pop songs. Our system is seamlessly integrated into Hookpad, a web-based editor designed for the composition of lead sheetsâ€”symbolic music scores that describe melody and harmony. Hookpad Aria offers numerous generation capabilities to support non-sequential composition workflows, including: (1) generating left-to-right continuations of existing material, (2) filling in missing spans within existing material, and (3) generating harmony from melody and vice versa. Since its release in March 2024, Hookpad Aria has generated 318,000 suggestions for 3,000 users, with 74,000 accepted into their songs."
